        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Oliver and this is a little bit about me. I am a <em></em> at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. This programe focuses on multiple aspects of digital media production using apps like Adobe Ilustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom and other apps via the Adobe Creative Suit.
            We also learn about coding as seen with the creation of this web page using HTML.

        Now for a little more about me as a person. Before i came to <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> I was a student at <abbr title="l'Ecole National en Aerotechnique">l'ENA</abbr> in aerospace engineering, I spent a semester in that programe before realising that all the math and physiques wasn't for me. I was more of a creative person that a technical one, I still do enjoy mechanics like toying with cars and motorcycles but not as a career. I have a hobbiest backround in photography but thats where my knowledge ends in term of digital media production.
